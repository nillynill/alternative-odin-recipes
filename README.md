# alternative-odin-recipes
An alternative design and styling for the "Odin Recipes" assignment using HTML and CSS Flexbox.

I utilized Linux-Xubuntu, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Visual Studio Code, xfce4-terminal, Bash shell, Git and Github for this project.

As a person who loves art, design and math, I genuinely enjoyed the process of combining art, colors, graphics and technology. 

I collaborated with Microsoft's Text to Image AI to create this project's logo inspired from the original "The Odin Project Logo". And I am amazed by the ease and the fantastic graphic I got!
